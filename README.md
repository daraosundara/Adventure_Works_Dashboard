# Adventure_Works_Dashboard
This project explores the full range of Microsoft Excel as a data analysis tool including data cleaning, data modelling, statistical analysis and dashboard creation and design. 
  Data was sourced from Microsoft adventure works sample database. 
  Five tables were imported for this analysis(4 dimension tables and 1 fact table). Data modelling was done using power pivot and tables were joined on primary keys to establish relationships to aid in analysis.
  Statistical analysis was done with excel formulas such as MAX, LARGE, AVERAGE, SUM, IFS, VLOOKUP, and so on. Measures were also created and used for analysis using power pivot. 
  An interactive dashboard complete with filters by months, years and country was designed. Simple charts and stunning colours and visualizations were used to maximize interactive property of the dashboard and ensure data is easily questioned for insights and understood by anyone with simple clicks of a few buttons.
